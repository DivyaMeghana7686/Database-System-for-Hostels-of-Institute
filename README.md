We made a database system for the hostels in an institute on phpMyAdmin. We have written a few SQL queries which show the working of the database in the video (can be found in the github repository by clicking on 'Code' below). We've donr query optimization, generated triggers, and have also performed hashing on the tables present in the database. We've included the following features: -> Maintaining updated list of students in hostels -- includes realtime information on student taking leave from hostel and associated fees & rebates; --> Maintaining updated list of issues associated with a particular room; --> Maintaining details of wardens associated with particular hostels; --> Maintaining student information to include picture and other details; --> Database includes biometric inputs as well - to mark hostel-in and hostel-out times, if a student doesn't return by last in-time and not taken leave, then we ping hostel-caretaker / warden.
